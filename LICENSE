Final Cut Pro can transform the look of video shot in Cinematic mode on iPhone.1 With a revolutionary click-to-track feature, you can choose focus points in a shot and change them over time. You can also adjust a clip’s depth‑of‑field effect with a slider in the inspector, or use keyframes to change the amount of blur in already captured material.
